            <a href="">Web Site and Web Application</a>When someone says “website” you should think simple, single page sites or 
            marketing websites. Websites are built using HTML, CSS, and maybe a little 
            bit of JavaScript. No programming language is required, and neither is a database.
        </p>
        <p class="success backflip">
            Websites are a huge part of the web and play super important functions like telling 
            you today’s special at your local Italian meatball shop, or letting you know about 
            a hot new startup that is about to launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here’s what you need to ask yourself if you have a web project you are working 
            on: how often does this site need to be updated? Monthly? Weekly? Hourly? Do users 
            provide some of the content? Can you pull data automatically and auto-update your site?
        </p>
        <p>
            Your answers to those questions will go a long way towards helping you determine if it’s
            a website or a web application that you’ve got on your hands!
